    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will parse a website with a domain registered in Kazakhstan (\".kz\"), extract relevant data, and conduct detailed data preprocessing and visualization using Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Website Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a website with a \".kz\" domain that contains structured data you can scrape (e.g., a market website, real estate listings, job listings, or product prices).\n",
    "- Ensure that the website allows scraping and has relevant data fields (such as prices, ratings, categories, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Web Scraping:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Python libraries such as `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` (or `Selenium` if necessary) to scrape the chosen \".kz\" website.\n",
    "- Parse the HTML and extract multiple variables (such as product names, prices, categories, ratings, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform thorough data cleaning, including handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions.\n",
    "- Ensure that the data is standardized and formatted properly.\n",
    "- Provide a summary of the cleaning process and the rationale behind each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Pandas and NumPy to perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "- Calculate descriptive statistics and identify key relationships and trends within the scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Data Visualization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create at least five insightful visualizations using Seaborn that effectively communicate the key findings from your analysis.\n",
    "- Use a variety of plot types such as scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.\n",
    "- The visualizations should be logically structured and provide meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Comment Your Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure to comment on your code to explain each step clearly.\n",
